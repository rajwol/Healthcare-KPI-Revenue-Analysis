# **Healthcare Dataset Analysis**

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing synthetic healthcare data using both SQL and Power BI to generate and visualize insights. The analysis focuses on identifying key year-over-year (YoY) hospital metrics, including total revenue generated, average billing per visit, patient admissions, and average length of stay (LOS) in days. To ensure data quality, Power Query was utlized to clean irregularities, handle missing or inconsistent records, and create unique identifiers for a more reliable analysis. Additionally, dummy data was added specifically into the 2024 records to balance the dataset and ensure consistency for comparative analysis across the measured years.

The cleaned dataset was then analyzed using SQL queries, where advanced Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions were utilized to uncover trends and patterns across different dimensions. These derived insights were subsequently visualized in Power BI, employing advanced DAX measures and dynamic parameters to provide an interactive, user-friendly dashboard for hospital performance monitoring.

- **Source**: [Synthetic Healthcare Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset/data)

- **Timeframe**: 2019-2024

## **Objectives**

- Analyze revenue, patient admissions, average billing per visit, and the average LOS (days) across the years. Compare these findings to prior-year data to provide insights into hospital performance, highlight growth patterns, cost consistency, and operational shifts

- Evaluate doctor performance by identifying who generated the highest revenue and track YoY increases, providing insights into individual contributions and potential areas for growth.

- Examine the distribution of admission types (Elective, Urgent, Emergency) and medication usage patterns to identify recurring trends and potential shifts in treatment approaches.

## **Key findings & Insights**

1. The hospital experienced substantial growth in generated revenue and patient count from 2019 to 2020, followed by relatively stable figures until 2024, where average LOS increased dramatically and revenue declined by $11 million. This warrents a more in-depth investigation into the factors contributing to the LOS spike and potential strategies to reduce average patient LOS without compromising the quality of care.

2. Even through fluctuations in total revenue generated by the hospital, the average cost per visit remains consistently around $25,500 across the analyzed years, indicating stable pricing structures and consistent operational practices.
   
3. Despite the $11 million revenue decline in 2024 for the entire hospital, Doctor Mark Johnson recorded an approximate $217K billing increase in billing compared to 2023. This suggests an increase in patient volume and/or increase in high-cost treatment and specialized care services.

4. Admission and prescribed medication type remain consistent throughout the measured time frame, suggesting stable patient care patterns and consistent treatment protocols.

5. Insurance providers experiences a higher volume of claims in 2020, potentially driven by external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic or changes in policy. The significant revenue increase of $96 million between 2019 and 2020 further supports this observation.
